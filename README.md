# Covid Crisis Chatbot
The COVID-19, also known as the coronavirus, is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2). The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January, and a pandemic on 11 March. Today’s audiences prefer social media over traditional channels but many social media channels have been challenged by fake news and privacy breaches, and aren’t always fully reliable. This is where our Chatbot solution “YODA” integrated into a platform comes into picture with its modern features like text-based interaction, ML, Thermal Imaging, Sentiment Analysis and a Doctor-Patient portal to address the coronavirus crisis

```bash
npm install

##Objectives

```Chatbots are perfect for when users are appearing on any kind of website for location based information or generic COVID-19 related information. Especially since they cannot wait to talk to real person, this information is crucial to be received right away 24/7. They are asking questions like:
•	What is the number cases in a specific area
•	What is the lockdown situation
•	Where can I get a test done or nearby medical facility?
•	What are the symptoms
•	How does the virus spread?
•	Support systems can range from financial consulting to mental health counseling
•	ML algorithms for prediction of COVID for False Positive or False Negative cases.
•	Connect with the doctor by sitting at your home.
